            "The error message indicates that there is a problem with the \"Hubbard_occ\" variable in the &system namelist. The error could be due to an incorrect value or format for \"Hubbard_occ\", or an issue with the pseudopotentials being used.\n\nBased on the documentation provided, the \"Hubbard_occ\" parameter is used for DFT+U Hubbard correction, LDA+U calculations, strongly correlated electrons, transition metals, and rare earth elements. However, in the input file, the value for \"Hubbard_occ\" is set to \"read from pseudopotentials\", which is the default value. Since the error message suggests that there is a problem with this value, it is likely that the pseudopotentials being used do not support the Hubbard correction.\n\nTo fix this error, we can remove the \"Hubbard_occ\" parameter from the &system namelist, since it is not necessary for this calculation. Additionally, we can add the \"Hubbard_beta\" parameter to the &system namelist, since it is required for DFT+U calculations.\n\nHere is the corrected input file:\n\n```fortran\n&CONTROL\n    title = 'test'\n    calculation = 'relax'\n    tprnfor = .TRUE.\n    etot_conv_thr = 1.0D-4\n    forc_conv_thr = 1.0D-4\n    pseudo_dir = '/home/ws/ec5456/VS-nano/kg_qe_tmp3/kg_qe/new_pp'\n    outdir = '/home/ws/ec5456/VS-nano/kg_qe_tmp3/kg_qe/out_dir'\n/\n\n&SYSTEM\n    ibrav = 0\n    nat = 2\n    ntyp = 1\n    occupations = 'smearing'\n    degauss = 0.01\n    smearing = 'marzari-vanderbilt'\n    nqx1 = 16\n    nqx2 = 16\n    nqx3 = 9\n    ecutwfc = 50.0\n    ecutrho = 200.0\n    !Hubbard_occ = read from pseudopotentials\n    Hubbard_beta = 0.0\n/\n\n&ELECTRONS\n    scf_must_converge = .TRUE.\n    conv_thr = 1.D-8\n    mixing_mode = 'plain'\n    mixing_beta = 0.4D0\n    startingwfc = 'atomic+random'\n/\n\n&IONS\n    ion_positions = 'from_input'\n    ion_dynamics = 'bfgs'\n    wfc_extrapolation = 'second_order'\n    ion_temperature = 'andersen'\n    upscale = 200.D0\n    bfgs_ndim = 1\n    fire_falpha = 0.99D0\n/\n\nATOMIC_SPECIES\nHf     178.49 Hf-sp.oncvpsp.upf\n\nATOMIC_POSITIONS angstrom\nHf           0.0000000000       1.8473700639       1.2654351152\nHf           1.5998694056       0.9236850320       3.7963053457\n\nK_POINTS automatic\n16 16 9 0 0 0\n\nCELL_PARAMETERS angstrom\n      3.1997388111       0.0000000000       0.0000000000\n     -1.5998694056       2.7710550959       0.0000000000\n      0.0000000000       0.0000000000       5.0617404609\n```\n\nIn this corrected input file, the \"Hubbard_occ\" parameter has been removed from the &system namelist, and the \"Hubbard_beta\" parameter has been added with a value of 0.0.
